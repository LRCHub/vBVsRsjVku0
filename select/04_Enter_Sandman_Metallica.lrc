[01:11.28] Say your prayers, little one
[01:13.36] Don't forget, my son
[01:15.29] To include everyone
[01:18.85] I tuck you in, warm within
[01:20.98] Keep you free from sin
[01:22.73] 'Til the sandman, he comes
[01:35.73] 
[01:26.76] Sleep with one eye open
[01:31.17] Gripping your pillow tight
[01:44.17] 
[01:33.72] Exit light
[01:37.86] Enter night
[01:41.45] Take my hand
[01:45.24] We're off to never-never land
[01:59.74] 
[02:03.28] Something's wrong, shut the light
[02:05.35] Heavy thoughts tonight
[02:07.20] And they aren't of Snow White
[02:11.12] Dreams of war, dreams of liars
[02:12.95] Dreams of dragon's fire
[02:14.98] And of things that will bite, yeah
[02:31.98] 
[02:18.96] Sleep with one eye open
[02:23.03] Gripping your pillow tight
[02:36.03] 
[02:25.94] Exit light
[02:29.89] Enter night
[02:33.65] Take my hand
[02:37.36] We're off to never-never land, yeah
[02:54.86] 
[03:26.18] Now I lay me down to sleep (now I lay me down to sleep)
[03:29.63] Pray the Lord, my soul to keep (pray the Lord, my soul to keep)
[03:33.22] If I die before I wake (if I die before I wake)
[03:37.02] Pray the Lord, my soul to take (pray the Lord, my soul to take)
[03:41.35] Hush, little baby, don't say a word
[03:45.56] And never mind that noise you heard
[03:49.53] It's just the beasts under your bed
[03:53.52] In your closet, in your head
[04:07.52] 
[03:56.83] Exit light
[04:00.71] Enter night
[04:04.57] Grain of sand
[04:08.52] Exit light
[04:12.43] Enter night
[04:16.24] Take my hand
[04:19.79] We're off to never-never land, yeah
[04:37.29] 
[04:27.45] Boo!
[04:30.80] Yeah-yeah
[04:35.30] 
[04:37.15] Yo, whoa
[04:41.15] 
[04:44.89] We're off to never-never land
[04:47.18] Take my hand
[04:53.18] 
[04:52.88] We're off to never-never land
[04:54.99] Take my hand
[05:00.51] We're off to never-never land
[05:15.01] 
[05:08.44] We're off to never-never land
[05:16.28] We're off to never-never land
[05:30.78] 
[05:24.06] We're off to never-never land
