The gates of time have opened
And now the chains are broken
An ancient force unleashed again as I enter the portal
I feel the enchantment
It takes me away, away from here come near me, enter my private chambers
I want to feel the warmth on my face
Light in darkness, lift me up from here
Give me your wings to flee from my ivory tower as I enter the portal
I feel the enchantment
The stars above are lying at my feet come near me, enter my private chambers
I want to feel the warmth on my face
Light in darkness, lift me up from here
Give me your wings to flee from my ivory tower
