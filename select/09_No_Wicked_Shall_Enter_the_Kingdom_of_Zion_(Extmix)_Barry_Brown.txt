This lyric contains biblical references. Click here to show the references.

Fittest of the fittest
The fittest of the fittest
The fittest of the fittest, hmm

If you are a wicked man you cannot
Enter the kingdom of Zion, oh no
If you are evil woman you cannot
Enter the promised land of Ethiopia, oh no
Better call on to Jah Jah, ah
I and I, Father, hmm
Selah, oh
Amlak, oh yeah

Jah said not one of his children shall go down
In the walls of Jericho
Let Jah arise and let his enemies be scattered away

So if you are a wicked man you cannot
Enter the kingdom of Zion, oh no
If you are evil woman you cannot
Enter the promised land of Ethiopia, ah
Better call on to Jah Jah, oh yeah
I and I, Father, hmm
Selah, oh yeah
Amlak, ah

(.)
Ooh, yes
Fittest of the fittest, yes
Fittest of the fittest

How good and how pleasant it is
For I and I to dwell together, oh yes
In the light of Jah Jah, oh yes
Let us live as one brother and sister
If you are a wicked man you cannot
Enter the kingdom of Zion, oh no
If you are evil woman you cannot
Enter the promised land of Ethiopia, ah
Better call on to Jah Jah, right now
I and I, Father, hmm
Selah, oh
Amlak, oh yes

Jah said not one of his children shall go down
In the walls of Jericho, I'm telling you
Let Jah arise and let his enemies be scattered away, oh yes
So If you are a wicked man you cannot
Enter the kingdom of Zion, oh no, no, no
If you are evil woman you cannot
Enter the promised land of Ethiopia, ah
Better call on to Jah Jah, oh yeah
I and I, Father, hmm
Selah, ah
Amlak, oh yeah

Better call on to Jah
You better call on to Jah
You better call on to Jah
You better call on to Jah
You better call on to Jah
You better call on to Jah
